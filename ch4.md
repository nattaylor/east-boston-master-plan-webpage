# CHAPTER FOUR - IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

The steps necessary to implement the Master Plan can be divided into four categories of activities: economic development projects, public realm iiitpmvmnents, regulatory action and community programs.

**ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS:**

## Retail Sector

In the short term, economic development opportunities in the retail sector will be buoyed by the growing expend? ture potential of East Boston residents and employees. In the long term, new in-Ell development potential especially along connecting corridors such as Meridian and Bennington Sheets and in Central and Maverick Squares can be expected, capitalizing on increased capture of visitor dollars and new waterfront projects.

Planning for continued economic strength in the retail sector should include the coordination and promotion of retail activities Within each commercial district through an expanded Main Streets program, the strengthening of ties between existing retail districts and key demand generators (commuters; employees, residents, toun'sts), and enhancement of the physical envie ronment.

## Hospitality Sector

In the short term, economic development in the hospitality sector Will be driven by development of affordably priced extended Stay business/tourist class hotel rooms within the McClellan Highway corridor and proximate to Logan Airport. In the long term, development of luxury waterfront hotel rooms may follow successful completion of the proposed East Boston water front residential developments with ancillary waterfront enhancements (Le. water shuttle, open space, marinas, and other attractions).

Planning for continued economic strength in the hospitality sector should include the coordination and promotion of East Boston retail districts and attractions for visitors to Boston, the encouragement and promotion of waterfront revitalization especially including ancillary waterfront enhance ments such as water shuttle, a waterfront trolley, open space. marinas, and other attractions, and enhancement of the physical environment.

## Office and R&D Sectors

In the short term, economic development in the office and R&D sectors will be seen primarily by increased use of upper floors (rehab and inufill) in exist" ing commercial districts and corridors oriented to business and professional service sector occupancy. 1n the long term, development of new commercial office space on the wateriront may fol low successful completion of the proposed East Boston waterfront residential developments With ancillary waterfront enhancements (Le, water shuttle, open space, marinas, and other attractions). Planning for continued economic strength in the office and R&D sectors should include promotion of East Boston retail districts' revitalization, continued development of the hospitality sector, the encouragement and promotion of waterfront revitalization, especially ancillary waterfront enhancer ments such as water shuttles, open space, marinas, and other attractions, and enhancement of the area's physical environment

## Industrial Sectors (Marine and Non-marine)

In the short tenn, the development of new industrial facihties within the McClellan Highway corridor to serve current under-supply of industrial space Will strengthen the industrial sector. Long term economic development goals for this sector require that sufficient land he zoned for these uses, including sites presently used for these purposes. Planning for continued economic strength in the industrial sectors should include the marketing of East Boston to targeted marine demand sectors (reere~ ational and commercial boat owners, marine service providers, and tourists), Ihe development of a strategy for subsidizing critical marine infrastructure improvements, and enhancement of the physical environment.

## Residential

In me short term, luxury rental development on the waterfront and moderately priced in-flll ownership and rental development in the neighborhoods and existing commercial districts are expected to characterize the residential sector. In the long term, development of luxury condominiums or co-ops 0n the waterfront should [c)llow successful completion of the proposed East Boston waterfront rental developments With ancillary waterfront enhancements (Le. water shuttle, open space, marinas, and other attractions). Planning for economic growth in the residential sector should include promotion of the revitaln ization at East Boston neighborhoods and retail districts, encouragement and promotion Of waterfront revitalization, especially ancillary waterfront enhanee~ ments such as water shuttle, open space, marinas, and other attractions, and enhancement of the physical environment.

## Public Realm Improvements

Public Realm Improvements recomi mended by the Master Plan are:

**Create** the Massport portion of Harborwalk as a first phase of Masspott Piers redevelopment initiative.

**Facilitate** formation of a museum by providing temporary space to various cultural interest groups to develop a business plan and program outlines, in]? tiate fund raising, conduct market [easibih'ty and design studies, and other necessary efforts to developing the museum recommended by the Master Plan.

**Expand** open space by creating parks at the public urban wilds location, Piers Park Phase II: and Pier 5, and public access to and along the water at Hess Oil and Boston East sites.

**Design** and creating distinctive signage and streetseape improvements for waterEtom streets along the East Boston waterfront from Marginal to Condor Streets-the bWaterfront Way.

**Facilitate** private water transportation projects such as the creation of a water shuttle service between Shaws Supermarket, the North End and Charlestown, and a waterfront trolley service linking Central and Maverick Squares With the Marginal Street water" front.

## Regulatory Actions

Regulatory Actions recommended by the Master Plan are:

**Establish** Urban Design Guidelines for waterfront and Harborwalk, historic districts and commercial district centers in order to ensure appropriate building scale and character of the waterfront, preservation of public spaces and the street environment, and respect of the historic fabric of the residential neighborhoods.

**Use** Article 80 Development Review of the Zoning Code to review proposed development projects and ensure participation 0f the community.

**Develop** a Municipal Harbor Plan for East Boston to be undertaken as soon as possible in order to address the issues associated With the Chapter 91 Waterways regulations, such as public access, protection of public interests in tidelands, and maritime industrial usage. It is important that this study be undertaken both with a view to East Bostonâ€™s development as well as the role East Easton's waterfront should play in the larger Boston Harbor context. As part of the Municipal Harbor Plan, supporting commercial uses within the DPA and the de-designation of Boston East as a DPA site should be investigated.

**Modify Current Zoning** The current zoning, the product of a 1997 study undertaken by the ERA in conjunction With the cemmunity, is largely consis tent with the Master Plan With the exception of a few changes. The [oilowing modifications should be afforded top priority as the tool for accomplish, ing neighborhood enhancements:

1. Establish a Corridor Enhancement District for Bennington Street which will safeguard the character of Bennington Street as a boulevard and protect it from fragmentation by practices such as unconsolidated curb cuts.
2. Expand -C0mmerciai Zoning Districts Expansion of Community Commercial Subdistrict to allow for greater Hexibilty in uses in commercial districts. Currently, Neighborhood Shopping Subdistrict areas do not allow for entertainment uses, second story retail and commercial uses
3. Extend Historic District recommendations to additional areas identified by the Boston Landmarks Commission. Communityebased groups should work with the Boston Landmarks Commission in a manner similar to the effort undertaken in Eagle Hill.

## Community Programs

**Expand** the Main Streets Program to Orient Heights and Day Squares. Main Streets is a program through the City Of Bostonis Department of Neighborhood Development. The program is intended to improve the physical appearance of neighborhood uMain Streets", offeiing matching grants for facade improvements as well as funds for lighting and landscaping. The programs is also intended to build a Community of businesses in a neighborhood business district that will engage in joint marketing efforts. Staff members of Neighborhood Development and Main Streets are available for technical assistance. Day Square and Orient Heights business and neighborhood constituencies should submit applications to the Main Streets Program so that it can be extended from Central and Maverick Squares to bolster these neighborhood commercial centers.

**Promote HomeWorks** as a means of rehabilitating historic buildings. The Department of Neighborhood Development sponsars lids giant program aimed at assisting homeowners Who undertake historically appropriate exterior repairs and improvements.

An outreach and educational program should be targeted to hisioric: neighborhoods through a coordinated effort of city agencies, neighborhood associations and local financial institutions.

**Create** a program for entrepreneurs to facilitate training and creation of busie nesses wilhin existmg East Boston comu mereial districts.

The strength of a neighborhood shopping district relies on both large Chains that bring a diversity of necessities at reasonable cost, such as supermarkets and drug stores, and shops that are owned by residents of the local and surrounding market areas and Which reflect the interests and culture of the community. The Cityis Small Business Assistance Center should be used as a resource for these locally-owned shops. Technical assistance with business development, administration and marketing is available through the center. Also grants for up to $2500 per client are offered. The Center Will also help businesses obtain loans and build credit histories.

**Implement** traffic calming measures. Trafiic calming in East Boston is primate 1'in aimed at measures to Limit airportgenerated and highway bypass traffic from using local streets. Measures to slow traiiic speeds are most appropriate along Benningtori Street between Neptune Road and the Revere boundary, where traffic volumes are heavy and fast-moving during peak hours. Such measures include signals with a progression timed for slower speeds. protected pedestrian crosswalks and signals at key locations such as META stations, nan
t rowing of the travel lanes, and restoraui tion of onestreet parking in certain Ioca i tions where it has bEen eliminated. It is also important to maintain and enforce existing traffic calming measures to pro) tect neighborhoods from airport traffic impaCts. These include restricting airport access from local streets to residents only atjeffries Street gate; using police details to restrict turns to local streets at Neptune Road exit ramps and to. keep airport traffic destined for the Sumner Tunnel on the highway; and to create discontinuuus 0ne-Way street pate terms to keep through traffic on arterial streets.

**Establish** a Neighborhood Transportation Association (NTA) under the auspices of the ERA and the Boston Transportation Department [:0 provide an effective mechanism for continuous tracking and updating of transportation conditimis and issues and. for community participation in the resolution of transportation issues. Funding for the NTA should be explored with CARAV VAN for Commuters, which provides assistance in forming and sustaining similar groups.

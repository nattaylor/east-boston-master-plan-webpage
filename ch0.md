Dear East Boston Friends:

It gives me great pleasure to release the East Boston Master Plan. This document is a community-based plan that establishes the framework lot Future development in East Boston, ensuring that the community's voice is heard before development occurs. The plan provides a balance between a variety of competing interests, all of Which are important. Thank you for all of your long hours at community meetings, thoughtful public comments and willingness to work together -- as a community W for the greater good.

East Boston’s proximity to downtown, its historic waterfront, and diverse population make the neighborhood one of the city’s best-kept secrets, As the waterfront evolves from a busy maritime industrial port to a mix of industrial, commercial, residential and recreational uses, many exciting opportunities for economic development are created. Development should and will be balanced and thoughtful. With this plan, your vision has laid the groundwork so that all future economic development will benefit the entire community, and no one will be left behind.

The Master Plan also builds upon East Boston’s natural and cultural resources. With the implementation of the open space strategy laid out in this plan, residents of East Boston will enjoy one of the highest concentrations of open space per square mile in our city. This is just one of the exciting prospects that have come out of the Master Planning efforts,

Strengthening neighborhoods, reviving the waterfront, enhancing commercial centers, energizing the McClellan Highway / upper Chelsea Creek corridor and seizing balanced economic development opportunities are all central themes in this plan. l look forward to continuing our work together. Our next step is to draft and submit to the state 3 Municipal Harbor Plan that Will enable your vision for the waterfront to be realized.

Please stay engaged in this important process. Together we are reshaping one of the City of Boston's greatest assets - its neighborhoods.
